# How to make a legit config for Galaxy Arduino and Raspberry

######Â this document has the intent to explain how the cheat configuration works so no one needs to spend money on something they can easily make themselves.

### Cheat explantion

Both Galaxy Arduino and Raspberry are color bots, so they use the color of the enemy team player outline as a reference point so the aimbot knows where to aim and the trigger bot knows when to shoot, this causes it to also aim at anything that has this same color causing some problems.

Knowing this is essential so we can **solve some commom problems**, like:

- The aim assist and aimbot trying to aiming at deady body's.
  
- Aim pulling to Killjoy's util like granades and turret.
  
- Aim pulling to Astra smokes.
  

Those are some of the most commom things you're going to encounter while using color based aimbots.

**Solving these commom problems**, is quite easy most of them can be solved with just a little of game knowledge and setting up the cheat.

### The basics of setting legit configs

If you want to have a good legit config is essential that you remember the basics:

- The lower the fov the less likely you are to just accidentally flicking to someones head or looking suspicius.
  
- The more smoothing you have the slower your aim will pull to the enemy.
  
- On triggerbot the lower the delay the faster the cheat will shoot for you
  

Having this in mind you can start making your own config.

### Aimbot

The aimbot works only when you have the key you set it up pressed, knowing this is really important so you can define how big you fov is going to be since it's only going to try to find something to aim at when you have the aimbot key pressed.

##### Making your config
